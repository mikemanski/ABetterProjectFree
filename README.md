# ABetterProjectFree
Simple Java client app to both watch and download videos, assisted by ProjectFreeTV's framework. Also bypasses all ad's of both ProjectFreeTV & the video hosts it links to.

Notes:
Currently, the only host this works with is vodlocker.
This works with TV shows, but not movies.
There is no error handling--if the host has deleted the video that is trying to be linked to, the program crashs. 
Home button functionality is still buggy (duplicate windows), but still functional.
