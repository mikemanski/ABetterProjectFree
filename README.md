# ABetterProjectFree
Simple Java client app to watch and download videos, assisted by ProjectFreeTV's framework 

Notes:
Currently, the only host this works with is vodlocker.
This works with TV shows, but not movies.
There is no error handling--if the host has deleted the video that is trying to be linked to, the program crashs. 
Home button functionality is still buggy.
